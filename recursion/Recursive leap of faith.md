The **Recursive Leap of Faith** is a problem solving framework where you *assume* that your recursive function already works correctly for sub-problems i.e. smaller inputs, and you focus on using that assumption to solve the *current* (target) problem. This approach enables you to design elegant solutions. 

This assumption allows you to focus on two critical components:  
1. **Base case:** the *simplest* scenario where the solution is so trivial that we can directly get the answer without any computation.
2. **Recursive case:**
