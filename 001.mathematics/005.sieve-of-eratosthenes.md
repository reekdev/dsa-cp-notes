## Problem
You are given a number $N$, you need to generate all the prime numbers smaller than or equal to $N$

## Concept

Instead of looping on every number from $2$ to $N$ and checking if it is a prime number (which is a $O(\sqrt{N})$ operation), we eliminate all non-primes (composites) by marking *multiples* of each prime starting from $2$

## Steps

Create a boolean array `primes[]` of size $N + 1$, where every element is initialized to `true`. This means we are assuming every number to be prime at first.

Set `primes[0]` and `primes[1]` to `false`, since 0 and 1 are not prime.

For every number `p` from $2$ to $\sqrt{N}$

If `primes[p]` is `true`, mark all multiples of `p` starting from `p * p` as `false`.

Why `p * p`? Because smaller multiples like `2*p`, `3*p`, etc., would have already been marked by smaller primes.

After the loop, all indices with `true` in `primes[]` represent the real prime numbers.

## Code

```java
static boolean[] primesTillN(int n) {  
    boolean[] primes = new boolean[n+1];  
    Arrays.fill(primes, true);  
  
    if (n >= 0) primes[0] = false;  
    if (n >= 1) primes[1] = false;  
  
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; ++i) {  
        if (primes[i]) {  
            for (int j = i * i; j <= n; j = j + i) {  
                primes[j] = false;  
            }  
        }  
    }  
  
    return primes;  
}
```
