## The problem  

Here you will find two kinds of problems.

**Variation 1: One that asks about distinct prime factors**  
In this case, if you are asked to do prime factorization of `60`  
then the solution should be `[2, 3, 5]` as they are the distinct prime factors of `60`

**Variation 2: One that asks about what is the count of those distinct prime factors (this is more practical)**
In this case, if you are asked to do prime factorization of `60`  
then the solution should be `{2=2, 3=1, 5=1}`  
This variation also requires the count of those factors. Here you need to use a map.

## Concept

Any number $N$ can be uniquely represented as:  
$$N = P_1^{\alpha_1} \times P_2^{\alpha_2} \times P_3^{\alpha_3} \times \cdots$$  
where:
- $P_i$ are prime numbers
- $\alpha_i$ are their respective exponents.

For example, the number $60$ can be expressed as
$$60 = 2^2 . 3^1 . 5^1$$

## Code

```java
static HashMap<Long, Long> primeFactors(long n) {  
    var primeFactorCount = new HashMap<Long, Long>();  
    for (long i = 2; i * i <= n; ++i) {  
        while (n % i == 0) {  
            primeFactorCount.put(i, primeFactorCount.getOrDefault(i, 0L) + 1);  
            n /= i;  
        }  
    }  
  
    if (n > 1) {  
        primeFactorCount.put(n, primeFactorCount.getOrDefault(n, 0L) + 1);  
    }  
    return primeFactorCount;  
}
```
