# Segmented Sieve

This algorithm helps in finding primes in a given range efficiently, especially when the range is large (e.g. $10^{12}$)


This is a space optimized version of sieve for handling the below cases:

1. $N$ is very large (e.g. $10^9$)
2. We have a range `[low, high]` as input and `high` is very large (e.g. $10^9$)

## Problem

You are given a range, you need to generate all the prime numbers in that range.

You need to find prime numbers in the range $[a, b]$ where:
- $0 < a \le b \le 10^{12}$
- $b - a \le 10^6$

## Concept

The segmented sieve algorithm divides the process into two phases.  

**Phase 1: Find small prime numbers**  
We first find all primes in the $[2, \lfloor\sqrt{b}\rfloor]$ range using the standard sieve of eratosthenes algorithm. These prime numbers will help in the second phase by marking non-prime numbers in the given range $[a, b]$  
The time complexity for doing this would be $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{b}\log\log\sqrt{b})$ 

**Phase 2: Use these small primes to mark non-primes in $[a, b]$**  
Iterate through each prime $P$ found in phase 1.  
Find the smallest multiple of $P$ in the range $[a, b]$  
Mark all its multiple as non-prime.
