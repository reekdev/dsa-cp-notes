# Segmented Sieve


This is a space optimized version of sieve for handling the below cases:

1. $N$ is very large (e.g. $10^9$)
2. We have a range `[low, high]` as input and `high` is very large (e.g. $10^9$)

## Problem

You are given a range, you need to generate all the prime numbers in that range.

## Example

```
Input: low = 2
```
