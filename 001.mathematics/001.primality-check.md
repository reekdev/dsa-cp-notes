# Primality check

When we want to determine if a number $N$ is prime or not, we need to check whether it has any divisors other than $1$ and itself i.e. $N$   

A straightforward approach would be to check all integers from $2$ up to $N−1$ to see if any of them divide $N$ evenly. However, this is inefficient, especially for large numbers.  

A more optimized approach is to check for divisors only up to the $\lfloor\sqrt{N}\rfloor$   
This significantly reduces the number of checks needed.

## Why does this work?  
If a number $N$ is not prime i.e. it is composite, then it can be factored into two numbers such that
$$N = A * B \quad \text{where} \quad 1 < A \le B < N$$

Now, among these two factors, at least one of the factors **must be less than or equal to** $\sqrt{N}$  
Why?  
Suppose, for contradiction, the both $A > \sqrt{N}$ and $B > \sqrt{N}$  
Then, $A * B > \sqrt{N} * \sqrt{N} = N$  
This implies, $A * B > N$ which contradicts $A * B = N$  
This means, our assumption 


## Code

**The basic variation:**  

```java
static boolean isPrime(long n) {  
    if (n <= 1) return false;  
    for (long i = 2; i * i <= n; ++i) {  
        if (n % i == 0) return false;  
    }  
    return true;  
}
``` 

**A more optimized variation:**  
The idea is that if we check divisibility by $2$ and $3$ first then we can skip checking for them in the iterations.

```java
static boolean isPrime(long n) {  
    if (n <= 1) return false;  
    if (n == 2 || n == 3) return true;  
    if (n % 2 == 0 || n % 3 == 0) return false;  
  
    for (long i = 5; i * i <= n; i = i + 6) {  
        if (n % i == 0 || n % (i + 2) == 0) return false;  
    }  
  
    return true;  
}
```
