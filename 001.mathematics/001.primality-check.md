# Primality check

When we want to determine if a number $N$ is prime or not, we need to check whether it has any divisors other than $1$ and itself i.e. $N$   

A straightforward approach would be to check all integers from $2$ up to $N−1$ to see if any of them divide $N$ evenly. However, this is inefficient, especially for large numbers.

```java
static boolean isPrime(long n) {  
    if (n <= 1) return false;  
    for (long i = 2; i * i <= n; ++i) {  
        if (n % i == 0) return false;  
    }  
    return true;  
}
```
